# ADR-001: Microservices Architecture

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2024-01-15  
**Deciders**: Architecture Team  

## Context

The LibraryApp system needs to be designed to handle growing user bases, complex business logic, and evolving requirements. We need to decide on the overall architecture pattern that will guide our development.

## Decision

We will adopt a **microservices architecture** pattern for the LibraryApp system.

## Rationale

### Benefits of Microservices Architecture

1. **Scalability**
   - Individual services can be scaled independently based on demand
   - Different scaling strategies can be applied per service
   - Resource allocation can be optimized per service

2. **Technology Diversity**
   - Different services can use different technologies if needed
   - Teams can choose the best tools for specific domains
   - Easier to adopt new technologies incrementally

3. **Team Independence**
   - Teams can work independently on different services
   - Faster development cycles
   - Reduced coordination overhead

4. **Fault Isolation**
   - Failure in one service doesn't bring down the entire system
   - Better system resilience
   - Easier to identify and fix issues

5. **Deployment Independence**
   - Services can be deployed independently
   - Reduced deployment risk
   - Faster time to market for features

### Service Boundaries

We identified the following bounded contexts:

1. **Authentication Service**
   - User authentication and authorization
   - JWT token management
   - User roles and permissions

2. **Book Service**
   - Book catalog management
   - Book inventory tracking
   - Book metadata and search

3. **Member Service**
   - Member registration and profile management
   - Member status and preferences
   - Member communication

4. **Borrowing Service** (Part of Book Service initially)
   - Borrowing transactions
   - Due date management
   - Fines and penalties

5. **API Gateway**
   - Request routing and aggregation
   - Cross-cutting concerns (logging, monitoring)
   - Rate limiting and security

### Communication Patterns

- **Synchronous**: HTTP/REST for request-response patterns
- **Asynchronous**: Event-driven communication for loose coupling
- **Data Consistency**: Eventual consistency with event sourcing where appropriate

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Improved Scalability**: Can scale services independently based on load
- **Better Fault Tolerance**: Service failures are isolated
- **Team Productivity**: Teams can work independently with clear boundaries
- **Technology Flexibility**: Can use different technologies per service
- **Easier Testing**: Smaller services are easier to test in isolation

### Negative

- **Increased Complexity**: Distributed system complexity
- **Network Latency**: Inter-service communication overhead
- **Data Consistency**: Eventual consistency challenges
- **Operational Overhead**: More services to deploy and monitor
- **Development Setup**: More complex local development environment

### Mitigations

1. **Service Discovery**: Implement service registry for dynamic service location
2. **Circuit Breakers**: Implement circuit breaker pattern for resilience
3. **Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring across services
4. **Testing Strategy**: Contract testing and end-to-end test automation
5. **Documentation**: Clear API documentation and service boundaries

## Implementation Guidelines

### Service Design Principles

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each service should have one reason to change
2. **Business Capability**: Services should be organized around business capabilities
3. **Decentralized**: Services should be decentralized and autonomous
4. **Failure Resilient**: Design for failure and implement graceful degradation

### Technical Standards

1. **API Design**: RESTful APIs with OpenAPI specifications
2. **Data Storage**: Each service owns its data and database
3. **Communication**: Use HTTP for synchronous and events for asynchronous
4. **Monitoring**: Distributed tracing and centralized logging
5. **Security**: Service-to-service authentication and authorization

### Development Practices

1. **Domain-Driven Design**: Use DDD to identify service boundaries
2. **Contract Testing**: Implement consumer-driven contract testing
3. **Continuous Deployment**: Independent deployment pipelines per service
4. **Infrastructure as Code**: Containerized services with Kubernetes

## Alternatives Considered

### Monolithic Architecture

**Pros:**
- Simpler to develop initially
- Easier to test and debug
- Single deployment unit

**Cons:**
- Difficult to scale parts independently
- Technology lock-in
- Larger blast radius for failures
- Team coordination overhead

**Decision:** Rejected due to anticipated growth and team scaling needs.

### Modular Monolith

**Pros:**
- Clear module boundaries
- Simpler than microservices
- Single deployment and database

**Cons:**
- Still technology lock-in
- Cannot scale modules independently
- Risk of tight coupling over time

**Decision:** Considered as intermediate step but microservices chosen for long-term benefits.

## Monitoring and Review

This decision will be reviewed:
- **3 months**: Initial implementation feedback
- **6 months**: Performance and operational metrics review
- **12 months**: Full architecture assessment

Key metrics to monitor:
- Service deployment frequency
- System availability and fault isolation
- Development team velocity
- Operational overhead costs
